Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.""Last week we hinted at what was to come as Ebola fears spread across America. Today, we get confirmation.

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneatenand stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. ""Were pretty sure its the oldest burger in the world,"" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend ""started off as a joke,"" he adds, but ""the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""Dean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and ""showed off the mold-free specimen,"" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called ""Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, ""Free the Burger,"" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000.

British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag shibal_alBaghdadi  which translates as the cub of Baghdadi  on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISISs self-proclaimed caliph.Abu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR Islamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem more brutal than it is, the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.It seems like a very legitimate thing, Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. I would vouch for it.A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media, the UN reported.Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS, said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, were going to see this face to face, she said.Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.""At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend  blamed by security sources on the insurgents  that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins, the officer said.He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children, he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five, Tada said."Zhang Jianyi is a bad roomate but sometimes cute
